## DESCRIPTION

CloudMinion is a set of tools for identifying unused OpenStack VMs, setting and managing expiration dates, shutting down and deleting expired VMs.

It consists of the following components:
  - cm_agent.pl  - Tool which runs on the OpenStack compute nodes and collects info from the VMs by guestmounting them in RO mode.
  - cm_manager.pl - Tool for managing the VMs by setting expiration date, shutting down and deleting expired VMS, sending notifications, etc.
  - vmem.cgi - GUI for managing the expiration date of the OpenStack VMs.
  - Supporting scripts and tools for emailing, running OpenStack commands, etc.



## REQUIREMENTS

Packages:
 - perl-DBD-MySQL needs to be installed on all compute nodes and the management node.
 - perl-Mail-Sendmail needs to be installed on the management node

DB:
 - A cloud_minion database needs to be created, preferably on the same db host where nova and keystone databases are located.
 - An account with create, insert, delete, update, select privileges needs to be created for the above database.
 - The account above or another readonly user (with select privileges) needs to have access to nova and keystone databases



## Installation
CloudMinion Management tools need to be installed on a management node and the agent on all compute nodes.

# Preparation
 1. Create a cloud-minion database for this project with user and password, or you can use another existing DB
 The user needs to have select, insert, update, delete, create privileges
 2. Create a read-only user, grant  select privileges only to nova and keystone DBs.
 3. Pull the CM project 
    https://github.com/paypal/cloudminion.git
 4. Update cloudminion/conf/cm.cfg and  cloudminion/conf/cm_agent.cfg with values for your cloud
 5. Open each file under cloudminion/bin/ and change the base_dir  to your installation path
 6. Create instance_lifetimes table in the cloud-minion db  by running 
    mysql .h <db host> .u <cm username> -p  <cloud-minion db>  < cloudminion/install/instance_lifetimes.sql

 
# Installing CM on a management node
 1. Create a base directory for CM, example /opt/cloud_minion, and copy all updated directories and files
 2. Install perl-DBD-MySQL and perl-Mail-Sendmail (yum install perl-DBD-MySQL perl-Mail-Sendmail)


# Installing CM on the compute nodes
 1. Create a base directory for CM, example /opt/cloud_minion
 2. Copy  bin/cm_agent.pl  and conf/cm_agent.conf to all nodes under the base_dir
 3. Install perl-DBD-MySQL   (yum install perl-DBD-MySQL)
